<h1 align="center">Vupx Engine</h1>
<h2 align="center">A 2D/3D game engine for the Nintendo Switch made with Haxe!</h2>

![Vupx Engine Logo](./docs/Assets/Logo.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The engine is still in development, so there may be some bugs, instability and many changes constantly!

-----------

Vupx Engine is a framework engine built with the [Haxe language](https://haxe.org) along with SDL2, OpenGL 4.3, libnx for Nintendo Switch and many other libraries, inspired in part by [HaxeFlixel](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel), and completely open source! All under the [HaxeNXCompiler](https://github.com/Slushi-Github/HaxeNXCompiler) project

If you want to create your games for this console using Haxe, but don't want to go through the agreements imposed by joining the Nintendo Developers program, this is your solution (at the expense of them being homebrew games and obviously not being able to publish them on the Eshop, in which case you have alternatives such as [itch.io](https://itch.io), [GameJoft](https://gamejolt.com) or [Homebrew App Store for Nintendo Switch](https://hb-app.store/switch)).
